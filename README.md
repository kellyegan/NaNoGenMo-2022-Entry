# NaNoGenMo-2022-Entry

A collection of entries for NaNoGenMo-2022

After several unfinished attempts at NaNoGenMo in past years, I am trying a different tack and starting the month with a completed novel. This novel or "no"vel is very simple: a book of approximately 50,000 no's. 

I plan to make some more novels perhaps a bit more advanced and add them to this repo.

## Novels

* *No-vel*: a novel made of 50,000 random variations on "no"s
* *Never, nooooooooooo noo*: From no to yes in 50,000 words uses tracery.
* *I will not stand it any longer*: A collection of statements of what the author won't do, using markov chains.
